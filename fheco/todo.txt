- handling case of outputs in rewrite, so if lhs is an output then we have to make the rhs as an output as well (done)
- after rewrite rule is applied node type could change, we need to consider that (done)
- convert exponentiate to multiplication with squares (done)
- replace rotate_rows by rotate in IR and later during code generation we generate rotate_rows if the backend is SEAL (done)
- revisit isone and iszero (done)
- automatic check before applying a rule instead of passing the flag CIRCUIT_SAVE_FLAG 
- checking correctness of rules and problem of increasing mul in matrix mul also checking cse
