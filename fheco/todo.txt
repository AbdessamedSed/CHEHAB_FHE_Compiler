- handling case of outputs in rewrite, so if lhs is an output then we have to make the rhs as an output as well (done but not tested yet)
- after rewrite rule is applied node type could change, we need to consider that (working on it ...)
- convert exponentiate to multiplication with squares
- replace rotate_rows by rotate in IR and later during code generation we generate rotate_rows if the backend is SEAL
- revisit isone and iszero
